Yesterday, [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) [published my first article about FLIP animations in React](https://css-tricks.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-flip-animations-in-react/)! I've been wanting to write about it in detail for a long time and I'm glad it is finally live.

The world of React animations is full of frustration. Perhaps my next post should be about animating mount/unmount animations which are also a huge pain in the ass when it comes to React.
The code of [my own library, `react-easy-flip`](https://github.com/jlkiri/react-easy-flip) is heavily inspired by `framer-motion` (you can see the [code here](https://github.com/framer/motion). The fact that no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't come up with something even smarter, probably tells us that this is a natural limitation of React's architecture. It seems that the React core team is watching the React animation ecosystem closely and [might improve that in the future](https://twitter.com/sebmarkbage/status/1259991081300619264).
